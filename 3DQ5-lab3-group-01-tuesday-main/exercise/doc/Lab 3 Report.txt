Lab 3 Report
The implemented code effectively captures numeric key presses ('0' to '9') from the PS/2 keyboard, maintains a count of how many keys have been pressed since the last reset or power-up, and measures how many video frames have elapsed since the last key press. Two messages are displayed on the screen:

PRV <D> <PP> <FFF>: Displays the last numeric key pressed (<D>), the total count of numeric keys pressed since the last reset in BCD format (<PP>), and the number of frames passed since the last key press in BCD format (<FFF>).
MAX <D> <PP> <FFF>: Displays the maximum number of frames passed until the next numeric key press, along with the corresponding key and counts.
Register Usage Analysis

The code utilizes a total of 120 registers, allocated for various functionalities. Below is a detailed analysis of the register usage:
PS2_code_ready_buf (1 register): Used to indicate when the PS/2 code is ready to be processed.
PS2_reg (8 registers): Stores the received PS/2 codes, allowing the system to recognize which key was pressed.
delay_X_pos (3 registers): Used for controlling the display position of characters on the screen.
units_digit (5 registers): Represents the BCD value of the units digit for displaying the count of keys pressed.
tens_digit (5 registers): Represents the BCD value of the tens digit for displaying the count of keys pressed.
clock_div_count (25 registers): Manages clock division to synchronize the processing speed.
one_frame_clock (1 register): Tracks whether a single frame has passed.
one_frame_clock_buf (1 register): Buffers the single frame clock status.
counter (10 registers): Counts the total number of numeric keys pressed since the last reset.
frame_units (5 registers): BCD representation of the frame count's units digit.
frame_tens (5 registers): BCD representation of the frame count's tens digit.
frame_hundreds (5 registers): BCD representation of the frame count's hundreds digit.
comparator (1 register): Compares the current frame count with previous values to determine maximums.
max_frame (10 registers): Holds the maximum frame count recorded since the last key press.
max_tens_digit (5 registers): BCD representation of the maximum frame count's tens digit.
max_units_digit (5 registers): BCD representation of the maximum frame count's units digit.
max_frame_units (5 registers): Holds the BCD representation of the maximum frame count's units digit.
max_frame_tens (5 registers): Holds the BCD representation of the maximum frame count's tens digit.
max_frame_hundreds (5 registers): Holds the BCD representation of the maximum frame count's hundreds digit.
Additionally, there are 10 registers dedicated to represent the states

This analysis indicates efficient use of registers while adhering to the design specifications. The design is optimized for counting and displaying information based on user input from the PS/2 keyboard.
